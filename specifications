Six components:
1. Initialization
2. Feature Detection/Matching
3. Motion Estimate
4. Map Management
5. Bundle Adjustment
6. Visualization Module


Initialization:
    - ORB->depth information using Semi-Global Batch Matching Algorithm
    - Obtain Disparity Map
    - 3D reconstruction


Feature Detection:
    - ORB features implemented-> Feature Matching between adjacent frames
    - Uniform distribution of features important. ANMS algorithm for that
    - Cross checking feature mapping

Motion Estimation
    - Done by 3D-2D Perspecitve n Point Method
    - RANSAC Outlier Rejection algorithm
    - Minimize reprojection error by using Optimization methods
    - Motion Estimation pipeline a state machine with 3 states. 

Map Management
    - Keyframe selection criteria
    - Keyframe -> new feature points triangulated
    - Reliable landmarks are added
    - Observations and connections between landmarks
    - Map -> Multiple keyframes -> Multiple Features. 
    - Each feature knows the ID of its frame. 
    - Connection between features and landmarks established
    - Keyframes and landmarks stored in hashtable (unordered_map)

Bundle Adjustment
    - Done on active keyframes and landmarks
    - Away from probabilistic bundling
    - G20 framework
    -
